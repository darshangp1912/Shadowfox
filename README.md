This project implements an N-gram language model in Python to perform next-word prediction based on the context of previous words. It involves preprocessing raw text data by cleaning and tokenizing it, and then constructing n-gram frequency distributions using defaultdict and Counter. These distributions help in identifying the most likely next word given a sequence of n-1 words.

The system is foundational for applications such as:

Predictive keyboards

Autocorrect systems

Chatbots

Text generators


This serves as a basic NLP (Natural Language Processing) project that demonstrates the use of simple statistical models for language understanding and generation
